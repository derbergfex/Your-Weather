# Your-Weather

This weather application can be viewed at https://codepen.io/derbergfex/full/yoVYep/

The purpose behind building this application was to get some practice using APIs and JavaScript in general. 
I have used HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then used APIXU's weather API to build this app.
The user can choose to view their local weather in celcius or in fahrenheit by simply clicking their respective buttons.

To edit or add features to the web app on CodePen, simply press the 'Fork' button on the top-right side of the page.
